# How to contribute

In the first place, thank you for thinking about contributing to **xcode-kotlin**!
Here you can find a set of guidelines for pitching in.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please, contact us in the Kotlin [Community Slack](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/) in
[the #touchlab-tools channel](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CTJB58X7X). To join the Kotlin Community Slack, 
[request access here](http://slack.kotlinlang.org/).

For direct assistance, please [reach out to Touchlab](https://touchlab.co/contact-us/) to discuss support options.

## Set up environment

For instructions on how to set up your environment and run the project, refer to the 
[README](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin/blob/main/README.md) and 
[BUILDING](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin/blob/main/BUILDING.md).

## Create an issue

If you have stumbled across a bug or have a good feature suggestion / enhancement, you can create an 
[issue](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin/issues), but please don't mistake it for the general helpline. You can 
get answers for general questions in Slack. Please, fill in carefully all the info the issue template suggests. It will 
save us time when investigating the problem. There might be a bit of a delay until we get to your ticket, so we ask for 
your patience.

## Submit a merge request

If you wish to participate in submitting code changes, to start with, you can look for issues tagged with **good first 
issue**. In case you feel like making significant changes or adding features, please discuss with the team first before 
you start working on it, to ensure we are on the same page. When your fix / feature is ready, create a merge request 
using the pull request template and fill in as much information as possible. All merge requests need to pass a code 
review from our team member, and subsequently they are approved or rejected with a reason. It might take some time 
before we get to your merge request, but donâ€™t worry, it didn't get lost.
